This example demonstrates a common Firebase configuration error and its solution.  The error arises from providing an incomplete or incorrect Firebase configuration object to the SDK.  The solution involves verifying and correcting the configuration details within your `firebase.json` or environment variables to match your Firebase project settings.  Ensure you are using the correct API key, auth domain, and other project-specific details. Incorrect configuration will prevent your application from connecting to Firebase services.
